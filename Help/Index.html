            </h1>
        </div>
        <p>
            NoNoun is a Chrome Extension that allows you to replace gender-specific pronouns (“he”, “she”),
            objects (“his”, “her”), and possessives (“his”, “her/hers”) with gender-neutral alternatives
            on English language Web pages. 
        </p>
        <p>It turns a page that looks like this:</p>
        <div class="large-img">
            <img src="images/before-1100.png" />
        </div>

        <p>into a page that looks like this:</p>

        <div class="large-img">
            <img src="images/after-1100.png" />
        </div>

        <h2>The Her/Her Problem<a name="HisHerProblem"></a></h2>
        <p>
            NoNoun uses simple pattern matches to make replacements. This can lead to mistakes with the word “her”,
            which is sometimes an object (“I talked to her.”) and sometimes a possessive (“I talked to her mother.”).
        </p>

        <h2>Questions & Answers</h2>
        
        <div class="question">Can I control what gender-neutral words to use?</div>

        <p>
            Yes. By default, NoNoun uses “o” for “he” and “she”, “om” for “him” and “her”,
            and “oz” for “his” and “hers”. But you can specify any words you like.
        </p>

        <div class="question">Can I control which gender-specific words to replace?</div>

        <p>
            Yes. For example, you may decide that because “she”, “her”, and “hers” are rarely used in
            gender-neutral ways, you want to replace “he”, “him”, and “his”, but leave “she”, “her”,
            and “hers” alone. To do this, leave the replacement boxes for the words to leave alone empty.
            Or, fill the replacement boxes with the same value (replace “her” with “her”).
        </p>

        <h3>Disclaimers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                NoNoun uses simple pattern matching for replacements. It may make mistakes. It may
                miss some locations or accidentally act on some locations it shouldn't.
                See the <a href="#HisHerProblem">her/her problem</a> as one other potential issue.
            </li>
            <li>
                NoNoun may not work on misbehaving Web pages (pages that generate errors that are
                often not seen by the reader).
            </li>
        </ul>
